# Challenge 

Figure out the largest product among a set of lists.  

# Input 

On the first line is an integer `N`, representing how many lists there are. 

Then there are `N` lines of text.  Each line of text contains a list of integers separated by spaces.  


# Output

Output the largest product among the lists.  In other words, for each list, multiply all of the numbers together and then find the largest product that results across all the lists.  

# Example Input 1 

If the input is 

```
4
2 1 2 4 7
3 5 -2 
1 8 9 9 0 
16 6
```

the output should be `112` because there are three lists with the following products: 112 (2\*1\*2\*4\*7) and -30 (3\*5\*-2) and 0 (1\*8\*9\*9\*0) and 96 (16\*6). 

# Example Input 2

If the input is 

```
2
1 4 -7 -10 5
-4 -8 -3 7 -6
```
the output should be `4032` because there are two lists with the following products: 1400(1\*4\*-7\*-10\* 5) and 4032 (-4\*-8\*-3\*7\*-6).
